# Species with representation in GenBank
These three Jupyter notebooks will check the representation of a list of species in GenBank, for a given gene (currently cox1) and will plot the results as stacked bars, for a given taxonomic level.  
Use *Count cox1 occurance in GenBank for a list of species* to search GenBank given a list of species.  
Use *ReadTaxonomy* to parse hierarchical taxonomy of your species  
Use *Plot* to plot the stacked barplots and histograms.
